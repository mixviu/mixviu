# Term parity work

Gold is MixOS `8779f33284b7d3f1178c3d57a699efb9b0867b22`.
Branch starts at integration `4f2c0fd`. Method: [parity-method.md](parity-method.md).
Gold remains installed. This lab specimen is **NOT ACCEPTED**.

## Inventory and ownership

The earlier [native requirements](term-needs.md) are requirements, not a port
receipt. Gold's `apps/term/src`, `crates/term-core`, `crates/term-render` and
patched `vendor/teletypewriter` are the implementation oracle.

| Area | Owner | Acceptance still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame, menus, actions, shortcuts, dialogs, macros | Mix | Full action registry, native callbacks and matched captures |
| Tabs, pane tree, profiles, launch and close policy | Mix | Every mutation, focus, title, ordering and refusal |
| Parser, grid, alternate screen, scrollback, search | Viu compound widget | VT conformance, bounded history, incremental damage |
| PTY, resize, child lifetime and session handoff | Viu native facilities | Real Mix login, sealed-fd isolation, generations, reconnect, reaping |
| Glyphs, ligatures, attributes, colours, cursor | Viu compound widget | Gold raster/GPU tests and matched real-session captures |
| Selection, clipboard, mouse, paste, IME | Viu compound widget | Native input, ownership, cancellation and late delivery |
| Fonts, scale, theme and terminal settings | Mix + Viu | Live Prefs on unchanged PID, authority loss/recovery |
| Bus | Mix + native authority | Gold commands, props, topics, payloads, errors and async completion |

Gold core exposes 23 commands (including seven original macro commands);
frontend adds actions/execute/show/dialog, toolkit drive, debug and complete
macro editing commands. The verified native control lane is a separate
authority contract. It must not be replaced by ambient credentials or an
app-local imitation broker.

## Initial frame specimen

`apps/term` adopts the shared gold frame at gold's 900×560 initial size.
The scene is deliberately empty while the compound widget is extracted;
no terminal, menu, Bus or visual parity is claimed by this checkpoint.
The window follows the generic host's live settings path.
