# Term parity work

Gold is MixOS `8779f33284b7d3f1178c3d57a699efb9b0867b22`.
Branch starts at integration `4f2c0fd`. Method: [parity-method.md](parity-method.md).
Gold remains installed. This lab specimen is **NOT ACCEPTED**.

## Inventory and ownership

The earlier [native requirements](term-needs.md) are requirements, not a port
receipt. Gold's `apps/term/src`, `crates/term-core`, `crates/term-render` and
patched `vendor/teletypewriter` are the implementation oracle.

| Area | Owner | Acceptance still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame, menus, actions, shortcuts, dialogs, macros | Mix | Full action registry, native callbacks and matched captures |
| Tabs, pane tree, profiles, launch and close policy | Mix | Every mutation, focus, title, ordering and refusal |
| Parser, grid, alternate screen, scrollback, search | Viu compound widget | VT conformance, bounded history, incremental damage |
| PTY, resize, child lifetime and session handoff | Viu native facilities | Real Mix login, sealed-fd isolation, generations, reconnect, reaping |
| Glyphs, ligatures, attributes, colours, cursor | Viu compound widget | Gold raster/GPU tests and matched real-session captures |
| Selection, clipboard, mouse, paste, IME | Viu compound widget | Native input, ownership, cancellation and late delivery |
| Fonts, scale, theme and terminal settings | Mix + Viu | Live Prefs on unchanged PID, authority loss/recovery |
| Bus | Mix + native authority | Gold commands, props, topics, payloads, errors and async completion |

Gold core exposes 23 commands (including seven original macro commands);
frontend adds actions/execute/show/dialog, toolkit drive, debug and complete
macro editing commands. The verified native control lane is a separate
authority contract. It must not be replaced by ambient credentials or an
app-local imitation broker.

## Initial frame specimen

`apps/term` adopts the shared gold frame at gold's 900×560 initial size.
The scene is deliberately empty while the compound widget is extracted;
no terminal, menu, Bus or visual parity is claimed by this checkpoint.
The window follows the generic host's live settings path.

## Native extraction, round 2

Fable D6 permits rio-vt's `simdutf` as **Viu debt**, with no change to D2's
strict Mix/mixd tier. The pinned source has scalar fallbacks, but these do
not establish equal malformed-UTF-8/base64 behaviour. This extraction retains
the pinned gold implementation and adds the foreign policy/gate. Viu, Rio
and simdutf are explicitly forbidden in all strict dependency closures.
The exit path is behaviour-tested pure-Rust validation/transcoding/base64.

`libraries/viu/src/terminal` now contains the gold native model, PTY Machine,
damage tracking, cluster interning, selection, mouse protocols, bracketed
paste, clipboard request queue, glyph raster, atlas/GPU grid and pane-owned
IME cancellation machine. Original tests remain; self-exec names are qualified
under the Viu module. Provenance records original source hashes and adaptations.

Native lease and write-permit mechanisms use in-process callbacks. This
separates lifecycle from the original Rust-owned TabSet; it does **not** claim
verified supervisor attachment, reconnect or generation acceptance. Those are
open integration work. No gold application/tab/pane Rust policy is imported.

Added conformance witnesses cover cursor address/insert/erase/alternate screen,
all UTF-8 and escape chunk boundaries in a representative stream, scrollback
and selection, and real Mix PTY input/resize/exit/reaping. Gold's GPU/CPU parity
and IME tests are included in the native gate. Results remain pending.

## Native widget checkpoint: tested extraction, app load open

At `f8b976e2cea7cc664c849982c98632759ec464b5`, CBC
`term-widget-r2-view-repair-a1` passed 133 tests (five original ignores),
Mix frame and wire tests, the foreign dependency closure gate and generic
host debug build, with no worker diff. The complete saved log was read.
This is native extraction evidence, not app or release acceptance.

Native sessions and the terminal widget are wired through generic Services
and SceneView. Mix has explicit selector validation and bounded replay for
synthetic input. A pure Mix tab/pane reducer now has checked tree traversal,
sibling focus, selector agreement, reorder revisions and the 32-slot cap.
It is not yet connected to the full app Bus/menu surface. Mix-authored split
composition is supported by the compound widget; its latest source is queued
for validation.

A private headless run captured pinned gold at 900×560 after deterministic
real Mix command output. The candidate failed initial behaviour loading, so
no matched pair or visual metric exists. Gold FileTerminal is now correctly
named `file-terminal`. The remaining first load error is obscured by later
callbacks; a new isolated actual-bundle test retains it for diagnosis.
The debug artifact and diagnostic bundle variants are not accepted bytes.
All recorded run processes were stopped; failed runs remain private.

## First native diagnostic pair (FAIL)

The actual-bundle test identified a scene/control ID mismatch: root was
a control whose definition ID was terminal. The scene now contains a
matching terminal node. A real candidate host then produced the same Mix
command output as pinned gold and a 900×560 capture at scale 1. The
candidate used the verified f8b976e debug executable plus the repaired Mix
bundle; this mixed-source repair witness cannot attest release bytes.

Both originals, full side-by-side and diff were inspected. Private receipt:
`term-parity-20261107/first-diagnostic-regions`. Gold run native.gWIe4o,
candidate native.iceFXQ; capture/readback/command and cleanup receipts retained.

| Bottom | 0,530,900,30 | 0.0798319 | 0.0308504 | Extra status bar/plug icon |

These are unfinished implementation items, not approved deviations. All
tracked candidate-run PIDs were stopped. The capture succeeded before the
generic close request exposed the missing app.quit handler; that handler
is now added and still requires the next gate/native-close witness.

## Exact widget and live tab/pane checkpoint

At exact code `b095d72222c3c6b018f59edf2d2be2eac483401a`, CBC3
`term-widget-r2-node-fixed-a1` passed 134 native tests, five retained ignores,
two actual-bundle tests, all three Mix suites, the foreign dependency gate
and generic host debug build. No worker diff. Debug SHA256:
`08375b79ec45e965bd258a1660080f572d3ec9dbf2b75ad27db545abae3b5990`.
Private `term-parity-20261107/native.uqPes6` used that executable and the
same archived source, executed the matched real Mix command output, captured
900×560 and passed normal close. All tracked PIDs were stopped. This closes
the first-load/quit defects; it does not change the visual FAIL verdict.

Code `39e1208653a54e0f0bc1b0a040713abc112fa721` connects the Mix reducer
to real session creation/close, tab selection/title/reorder, pane splits and
focus, explicit snapshot/type targets, and scroll commands. Native metadata
and output/title/exit changes reach Mix in process. The reusable document
strip now supports canvas attachment and leading status markers; Term uses
it above its compound surface. The shared frame supports omitting the status
footer, with the existing default preserved for other apps.

Four local Mix suites pass, including real selector disagreement, retryable
validation, request-key ordering, original-outcome replay and UTF-8 byte
bounds. The actual-bundle test now exercises native tab/split sessions,
inactive-pane input without focus movement, retry after close and final
shutdown. CBC `term-live-tabs-39e1208` is queued for this source; native
compile/runtime and new captures remain unverified until its result.

This is partial Bus implementation. Topic publication after props.watch,
the full action/menu/dialog/macro surface, raw-envelope validation and exact
large integer handling remain open, alongside verified native authority,
complete input/clipboard/search/Prefs and release visual acceptance.
